<h2>Analisys of project</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Today most of the programming industry uses class oriented programming languages and everybody should know how to use them to become a good programmer. Qt is a good example of a class oriented library that utilises signal and slot system, which is geting more and more popular. This gives us a conclusion that every programmer should know basics of Qt and class oriented programming</p>
<h3>Approach</h3>
<p>The program that I had to write was Battleships game using Qt library and C++ programming language, the purpose was to learn object oriented programming, for which this exercise was very good</p>
<h3>Problems</h3>
<p>Basic problem that I encountered while coding this program, was include loops, while trying to communicate Board classes with themselves. The problem here was Square class which only had control over what is happening on single square, and While trying to include said class to Board class, the include loop occured. The solution that I did was using Qt signal and slot system, which is a very good thing to know, especially now, where most of the applicaitons are made using this system.</p>
<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>The outcome of this program is working Battleships game, that can be only played with computer, featuring drag and drop system for ships, and graphic interface for easier interaction</p>
<h3>Improvements</h3>
<p>There are a lot of improvements what can be done, I will bulletpoint them out:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Better ai for computer, now it uses random shot system(code is prepared for this extension)</li>
    <li>Point system, which will tell how good the player was</li>
    <li>Difficulty system, eg. computer has more ships</li>
</ul>
<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>Testing was done on real players, one of which was me. Also during coding process I used debugging option of Visual Studio 2017 to test if program is running with good performace memory and processor wise</p>
<h2>How to use</h2>
<p>To run the game open "Battleships.exe", start the game using "Play" button, then drag and drop ships onto board(double click let's you flip the ship) and click "Start" button. After finishing you can restart the game with "Start" button</p>
<h2>How to compile</h2>
<p>Program was compiled using Visual Studio 2017 with qt tools installed. Program requires Qt 4.9.2 to compile</p>
